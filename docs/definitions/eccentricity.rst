============

  The **eccentricity** of a vertex in a graph is the maximum distance between
  this vertex and all other vertices of the graph.

Radius
------

  The **radius** of a graph is the minimum eccentricity from all vertices in the graph.

Diameter
--------

  The **diameter** of a graph is the maximum eccentricity from all vertices in the graph.
